## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 
To install dependencies

### `npm run dev`
The app will be loaded in 
http://localhost:8080/
### `npm run build`

before running this command, you need to run `npm run build` first.
Then app will be loaded in
http://localhost:3000/
